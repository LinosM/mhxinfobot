The **MiloHax Info Bot** is a Discord bot designed to provide quick and easy access to frequently requested information and resources related to various MiloHax projects, specifically focusing on Rock Band games. The bot responds to specific trigger phrases with predefined messages, links, and files to assist users in the Discord community.

## Features

- **Trigger-Based Responses**: The bot listens for specific trigger phrases in messages and responds with relevant information, links, or files.
- **Support for Long Responses**: Handles long messages by automatically breaking them into multiple messages, ensuring that each message adheres to Discord's 2000 character limit.
- **File Attachments**: Supports sending files like images, videos, and documents in response to triggers.
- **Configurable Triggers**: Triggers and responses are fully configurable via a `triggers.json` file.
